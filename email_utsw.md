From Dr.Day, 6/26/2025

Mr. xxx,

Good to hear from you.
 
I prescribe the below regimen (pentoxifylline 400 mg 2-3 times per day and vitamin E 1000 units one time per day) for patients with soft tissue radionecrosis (open wounds/sores) or osteoradionecrosis (open wounds/sores with exposed bone) to promote healing.  You don't have any of these findings.  
 
Would you mind sharing the evidence/trials you've identified suggesting this regimen might help you?   I'm always happy to learn.  What problem would this be treating?  Lymphedema?  Fibrosis?  There are more evidenced-based therapies for these problems.  For instance, for fibrosis, there is phase II data that taking a statin could reduce your risk of this.
 
Understanding what we're treating is helpful to know if the regimen is working and when we should stop it.
 
This might be a better conversation to have in-person or via telehealth.  I think it is probably too in-depth for a MyChart conversation...
 
Please let me know if I can help with anything else!
 
Andrew

Hi Dr. Day. Over the past several weeks, I’ve been experiencing increasing stiffness in the muscles of my neck and mouth. I’ve been doing stretching exercises and working with my physical therapy specialist, but unfortunately, the stiffness continues to progress.
In an effort to better understand my condition and explore additional treatment options, I’ve been reviewing some of the papers listed here:
 
https://github.com/recoverypath/update/blob/main/fibrosis.md
 
I recognize the complexity of this issue, as well as the limits of my own understanding—which is why I’m reaching out to seek your guidance.
 
During the last few days I noticed a significant change in my tongue. I have a constant mild burning sensation, the tongue feels more bulky than before and it looks different. Please see the attached picture.
 
Respectfully,
xxx

Hi Dr Day,
My PCP DR. Eppich reviewed this paper

https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis?csi=11f865fb-fbf8-4019-beca-e1dfee6b0291&source=contentShare

Based on info in that paper Dr.Eppich thinks it is OK to try pentoxifylline ER 400 mg tablet twice a day for three months.
He thinks it may reduce the effects of fibrosis in my neck and mouth.

Dr. Day, you have more experience treating patients with head and neck fibrosis due to radiation.
I would like to know you opinion. Does the paper provide convincing argument to trying pentoxifylline, or is it still not advisable?

Thank you
xxx
