When infection is persistent, the prolonged inflammation will become chronic gastritis. Initially, this will be non-atrophic gastritis, but the damage caused to the stomach lining can bring about the development of atrophic gastritis and ulcers within the stomach itself or the duodenum (the nearest part of the intestine).[14] At this stage, the risk of developing gastric cancer is high.[15] However, the development of a duodenal ulcer confers a comparatively lower risk of cancer.[16] Helicobacter pylori are class 1 carcinogenic bacteria, and potential cancers include gastric MALT lymphoma and gastric cancer.[14][15] Infection with H. pylori is responsible for an estimated 89% of all gastric cancers and is linked to the development of 5.5% of all cases cancers worldwide.[17][18] H. pylori is the only bacterium known to cause cancer.[19]
