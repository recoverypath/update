* [A randomized prospective study of extended tocopherol and pentoxifylline therapy, in addition to carbogen, in the treatment of radiation late effects; by S Brennan, O Salib, C O'Shea and M Moriarty; Published 9/6/2008 by eCancer.org; ](https://ecancer.org/en/journal/article/81-a-randomised-prospective-study-of-extended-tocopherol-and-pentoxifylline-therapy-in-addition-to-carbogen-in-the-treatment-of-radiation-late-effects)  ----  https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2008.81
  * Abstract:
    * Purpose: pentoxifylline (PTX) and tocopherol (vitamin E) are antioxidants previously shown to be useful in combination in the treatment of late radiation induced toxicity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the benefit of combination therapy with carbogen pentoxifylline and tocopherol in the mitigation of late radiation effects. As the optimal duration of PTX and tocopherol treatment has not been fully established, we studied short versus extended treatment duration.  
    * Methods: we conducted a phase II prospective randomized study of short versus prolonged treatment with pentoxifylline (800 mg) and tocopherol (1000 IU) orally once daily in patients with grade three toxicity post-radical radiotherapy. In addition, all 18 patients received inhaled carbogen (95% O + 5% CO2) over 90 minutes, five days/week, for three weeks. The primary end point was improved in maximum Lent-Soma toxicity scores.
    * Results: maximum Lent-Soma scores improved in six of the 18 patients (response rate 33%). The proportion of patients responding to treatment in the prolonged treatment arm B was more than double than in the shorter arm A, but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.321). Two patients who had prolonged treatment (arm B) had complete resolution of their symptoms, which was maintained at two and three year follow-ups.
    * Conclusions: we recommend prolonged treatment for 12 months, with PTX and tocopherol in combination with carbogen therapy, in the management of late radiation effects. 


* [Adverse Radiation Effects after Radiosurgery May Benefit from Oral Vitamin E and Pentoxifylline Therapy: A Pilot Study; by Richard Williamson; Douglas Kondziolka; Hilal Kanaan; L. Dade Lunsford; John C. Flickinger; Stereotact Funct Neurosurg (2008) 86 (6): 359–366](https://karger.com/sfn/article-abstract/86/6/359/308131/Adverse-Radiation-Effects-after-Radiosurgery-May?redirectedFrom=fulltext) ---- https://doi.org/10.1159/000163557
  * Abstract:
    * Background: Although uncommon, adverse radiation effects (ARE) are a potentially serious side effect of brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Corticosteroids are used to treat suspected ARE but side effects may be significant after long-term usage. Oral pentoxifylline (Ptx) and vitamin E therapy (VitE) are reported to benefit ARE seen in other organ systems. We treated 11 patients with suspected ARE after SRS with Ptx and VitE.
    * Methods: To assess the response, edema was measured using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Edema volumes were calculated by first determining the three maximum measurements in the X, Y, and Z planes of the image with the largest signal change. Volume was plotted over time for each patient that had serial MRI scans available. Two patients had 2 separate radiosurgeries and 2 patients underwent 3. Three patients received adjuvant whole-brain radiation therapy.
    * Results: The time until clinical detection of ARE after SRS varied from 3 to 18 months (median, 8 months). The change in edema volume varied from 59.6 ml in 1 patient (worse edema) to –324.2 ml (improvement). The average change in edema from pre- to post-treatment was –72.3 ml. One patient had more edema despite treatment; this patient was found to have tumor recurrence, and not an ARE. Two patients discontinued Ptx because of persistent nausea and abdominal discomfort. Conclusions: Ptx and VitE may be of benefit in the management of adverse radiation effects and should be studied further.
